# Emery Interactive

Working to recreate PDF files from [Jonathan Emery's GitHub site](https://github.com/emeryjdk/Interactive-3D-Exploration) within a HTML5, including WebGL using three.js. 

First, I will recreate [this PDF](https://github.com/emeryjdk/Interactive-3D-Exploration/blob/master/Asymptote-Source/FaceCenterCubic_Final.pdf).

Eventually we want to add Google Analytics, or other analytics technique, to track users' clicks, etc.
